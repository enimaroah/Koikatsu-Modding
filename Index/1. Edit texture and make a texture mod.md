The first tutorial will guide you to make a eyeline mod,in a simple way.

Before we start,think about what we need.A 'template' for draw eyeline,to help us find the correct position on head.After done the painting job,we gonna replace the exist resource.

At the begin,open abdata\chara and quickly view these files.You may find many files are named in order.Prefix ***ao_*** means Accessory,***bo_*** - Head and Hair,***mt_*** - Textures,Special cases like ***oo_base*** is for store body texture,***mm_base*** is for store body mesh,***face_present_50*** is for store default face preset and ***etc*** is for null reference.

Now let us get the eyeline UV,which is the template I mentioned before.For get the UV we need eyeline mesh from head model.
_<sup>*1</sup>:What is UV:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping_

Use SB3UGS to open ***bo_head_00.unity3d***,Double click ***p_cf_head_00*** at the right side of SB3UGS,,click ***Mesh*** Tab,click ***cf_0_eyeline***,at last click ***Export*** at the left of ***cf_0_eyeline***(don't touch the setting)
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/SB3UGS_export_eyeline.gif)

And then SB3UGS will create some folders under abdata\chara,which include the eyeline mesh we need.

Now use Blender to generate an UV image.When importing official asset we should scale up 100x(because official asset are really small)
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/scale100.png)

Press***left mouse*** to select model,***Tab*** to enter,***1*** to enter Vertex select,***A*** to select all the vertices,now pull out a new window,select ***UV Editor-UV-Export UV layout***,and then we got the UV image.

Since we got the UV,we are able to draw eyeline,with Gimp.Click ***File-Open*** to open file,next create a new layer and draw random lines on it.

![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/GIMPUV.png)

Before we export,scale down the eyeline work to 512x512.Click ***Image-Scale Image***,Set ***Width*** and ***Height*** to 512,then export the image.
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/gimpscale.gif)

Use the same method to an low resolution version of your paint,set the ***Width*** and ***Height*** to 256,add _low as suffix and then export.
_<sup>*2</sup>:What is _low:_low is the suffix what Illusion add to low poly model/low resolution texture.They usually used in school mode,to help reduce cpu/gpu usage.Name incorrect or missing _low will cause the resource won't shown up in school mode.

After done that,we need to check the eyeline effect we created,Now we could use replace method to quickly achieve the goal.

For replace the exist resource,we need to confirm what file to be the target.Open abdata\list\characustom,you may seen many files stored in numerical order.00 means this file is the base game resource,01 means the first update/DLC.

At here I choose ***00.unity3d***.Open ***00.unity3d***,you will discover the name order of animators are similiar to those resources which under abdata\chara.Here to open ***mt_eyeline_up_00***.
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/eyelineupSB3UGS.png)

***ID***: If you want to make a hardmod,make sure it doesn't conflict with the other IDs.

***Kind&Posses***: I don't what are those number stand for either(at least in this list file),make sure it same to the other。

***Name***:In-game name

***MainAB***:File path(default first level of folder is abdata in this list file)

***EyelineUpTex***:Resouce name

***EyelineShadowTex***:Eyeline shaodow(or kage in hiragana) name

***ThumbAB***:Thumbnail path

***ThumbTex***:Thumbnail name

Due to we gonna replace exist file,so find out one proper target is enough.At here I choose ***タイプ１***,and we know the file path of ***タイプ１*** is ***chara/mt_eyeline_up_00.unity3d*** from the list.

Back to abdata/chara,use SB3UGS to open ***mt_eyeline_up_00.unity3d***.Double click top open ***cw_t_eyeline_up_000***(not ***cw_t_eyeline_kage_000***!!!),now SBU3GS opened a Material Textures Animator for you to operate.Drag your paint work to SB3UGS,SB3UGS will create a Images tab to view external resouces.Chooose your eyeline image,then shift+left click ***cw_t_eyeline_up_000***,at last click ***Replace***.
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/replaceeyeline.gif)

Use the same method to replace ***cw_t_eyeline_up_000_low*** which under the ***cw_t_eyeline_up_000***,use _low version of your eyeline for replacement.

After all the things are done,press ***ctrl+s*** to save file(SB3UGS will create a backup)

Let us open the game and see the effect.
